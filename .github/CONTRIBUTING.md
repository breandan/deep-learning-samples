## Contribute

1. Check for open issues, or open a new issue to start a discussion around a
   new example or a bug.
2. If you feel uncomfortable or uncertain about an issue or your changes, feel free to contact us on Gitter using the link above.
3. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples.git) on GitHub to start making your changes to the **master** branch (or branch off of it).
4. If you're providing a new example, please help reference it by adding notes
   of relevant publications to the code comments, including links if
   available. If you fix an existing example, write a test, which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
5. Note the repository follows
   the [Google Java style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
   with two modifications: 120-char column wrap and 4-spaces indentation. You
   can format your code to this format by typing `mvn formatter:format` in the
   subproject you work on, by using the `contrib/formatter.xml` at the root of
   the repository to configure the Eclipse formatter, or by [using the INtellij
   plugin](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome/wiki/Installing-the-google-styleguide-settings-in-intellij-and-eclipse).

6. Send a pull request, and bug us on Gitter until it gets merged and published.
